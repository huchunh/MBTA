# MBTAProject
The MBTA database management system project involves the development and implementation of a centralized database to store and manage information related to the operations of the MBTA. This can include data on routes, ticketing, finances and operations. The goal of the project is to provide a single source of truth for all relevant data and to improve the efficiency and accuracy of MBTA operations.
This System facilitates functionalities like buying and top up- of tickets, pass as well as charlie cards, checking the status of the cards and their expiry dates, showing the stations for the transits, also the transactions in the stations with their timestamps and value. In Addition, the system also shows the operations whether the line and station is active or inactive due to construction or any other difficulties so that it's easy for the people to travel as well as it helps solve business problems and gather reports.

# Objective
To design a relational database that can storeï¼Œmanage, and retrieve MBTA information about stations, cards, tickets, recharging, check-in and lines in a secure and efficient manner.
The database should be able to provide information to monitor everyday operations, provide an overview of business statistics over a period, and help identify potential growth points for the MBTA system.
The system should enable commuting via various recharge types i.e., Rides, Passes and Wallet balance top up.
The system should discard/detect fraudulent transactions made by 3rd party intrusions by identifying the recharge device used for the recharge action.

# Tool
